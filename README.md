# Consequence Takehome Assessment

This application displays a carousel containing sample images from Consequence events. The purpose of this project is to insert an Ad slide after every nth slide a user scrolls through.

This application emulates the carousel displayed on the Consequence events page. The main difference with this carousel is that an Ad slide is inserted after every nth slide displayed. The carousel will move backwards and forwards, it also contains a thumbnail carousel in which a user can jump from different slides without scrolling through each event slide consecutively.

## Challenges

I have been tackling this assessment from various angles for the last year and a half. With each attempt, I have gotten closer to the ultimate goal, however the end result has never been reliable. At the very least, I have learned much from this project. See MVP.txt for more details.
